      <p>Welcome to Bushwax.co.uk</p>
      <h2>In response to a reddit question.</h2>
      <a href="https://ipv6.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/wp2ocx/what_ingredients_can_i_buy_with_20_to_make_enough/">The question that prompted this response can be found here.</a>
      <p>The responses to this question were all thoughtful and some very very clearly well researched.</p>
      <p>The question did evoke a different response from me.  I feel that there are other considerations that are prompting this question, some of which may not be being asked.  I have no idea of the situation of the person asking the question and I really hope I can stay clear of judgements or insinuations of that person or their situation.</p>
      <p>What are these considerations that may prompt someone to be careful with their budget?</p>
      <p>The most obvious consideration: That the person has a tight budget because their other living costs are increasing.  Lets explore some.</p>
      <p><ul>
        <li>Energy.</li>
        <p>What can be done about the rising energy costs?</p>
        
      </ul></p>
