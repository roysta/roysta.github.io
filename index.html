      <p>Welcome to Bushwax.co.uk</p>
      <h2>In response to a reddit question.</h2>
      <a href="https://ipv6.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/wp2ocx/what_ingredients_can_i_buy_with_20_to_make_enough/">The question that prompted this response can be found here.</a>
      <p>The responses to this question were all thoughtful and some very very clearly well researched.</p>
      <p>The question did evoke a different response from me.  I feel that there are other considerations that are prompting this question, some of which may not be being asked.  I have no idea of the situation of the person asking the question and I really hope I can stay clear of judgements or insinuations of that person or their situation.</p>
      <p>What are these considerations that may prompt someone to be careful with their budget?</p>
      <p>An exploration:</p>
      <p>Energy.</p>
      <p>What can be done about the rising energy costs?</p>
      <p>Some of the recommendations mention cooking a big hearty meal and apportioning into set meals for freezing.</p>
      <p>What about finding foods that can be eaten raw, remove the cooking cost altogether, as an example:<br>
      Cooked chickpeas in a tin cost ~2.40 per kg, whereas dried chickpeas cost ~1.75 per kilo.<br />
      Conventionally cooked hickpeas must be soaked overnight and then boiled or simmered for three hours.<br />Dry chickpeas are cheaper than cooked, tinned chickpeas, but once cooking times are taken into consideration, do they present better value?</p>
